                      Your prayers we do not heed—
                                     Don't go!
                           It's true we sigh,
                                But don't suppose
                           A tearful eye
                                Forgiveness shows.
                                     Oh, no!
                      We're very cross indeed—

       <p class = "speech">I can quite understand it.  (To 
        Fairies.)  Now here is
  a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike.  That man 
  has
  a most extraordinary effect upon me.  If I yielded to a 
  natural
  impulse, I should fall down and worship that man.  But I 
  mortify
  this inclination; I wrestle with it, and it lies beneath my 
  feet!
  That is how I treat my regard for that man!</p>
