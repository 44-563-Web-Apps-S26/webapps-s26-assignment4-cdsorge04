<p style = "margin-left:40px;">
     When all night long a chap remains<br>
       On sentry-go, to chase monotony<br>
  He exercises of his brains,<br>
       That is, assuming that he's got any.<br>
  Though never nurtured in the lap<br>
       Of luxury, yet I admonish you,<br>
  I am an intellectual chap,<br>
       And think of things that would astonish you.<br>
            I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!<br>
            How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!<br>
                 That every boy and every gal<br>
                      That's born into the world alive<br>
                 Is either a little Liberal<br>
                      Or else a little Conservative!<br>
                                     Fal, lal, la!<br>

  When in that House M.P.'s divide,<br>
       If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,<br>
  They've got to leave that brain outside,<br>
       And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.<br>
  But then the prospect of a lot<br>
       Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,<br>
  All thinking for themselves, is what<br>
       No man can face with equanimity.<br>
            Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!<br>
            That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!<br>
                 That every boy and every gal<br>
                      That's born into the world alive<br>
                 Is either a little Liberal<br>
                      Or else a little Conservative!<br>
                                     Fal lal la!<br></p>

            Carries every Bill he chooses.<br>
            To his measures all assent—<br>

                      Whigs and Tories<br>
                      Dim their glories,<br>
            Giving an ear to all his stories—<br>
            Lords and Commons are both in the blues!<br>
            Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!<br>
                 Shake in their shoes!<br>

(Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller from Westminster 
Hall.)</p>

       <h3>CELIA.</h3>  
       <p>You seem annoyed.</p>
       <h3>LORD MOUNT.</h3>  
       <p>Annoyed!  I should think so!  Why, this
  ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
  To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
  open to Competitive Examination!</p>
       <h3>LORD TOLL.</h3>  
       <p>And he'll carry it, too!</p>
       <h3>LORD MOUNT.</h3>  
       <p>Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
  Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!</p>
       <h3>LEILA.</h3>  
       <p>Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!</p>
       <h3>LORD MOUNT.</h3>  
       <p>The deuce it is!</p>
       <h3>CELIA.</h3>  
       <p>Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
  just as he wishes them to.</p>
       <h3>LEILA.</h3>  
       <p>It's our system.  It shortens the debates.</p>
       <h3>LORD TOLL.</h3>  
       <p>Well, but think what it all means.  I don't so
  much mind for myself, but with a House of Peers with no
  grandfathers worth mentioning, 
  the country must go to the dogs!</p>
       <h3>LEILA.</h3>  
       <p>I suppose it must!</p>
       <h3>LORD MOUNT.</h3>  
       <p>I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
  a great respect for brains—I often wish I had some myself—but
  with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,
  what's to become of the House of Commons?</p>
       <h3>LEILA.</h3>  
       <p>I never thought of that!</p>
       <h3>LORD MOUNT.</h3>  
       <p>This comes of women interfering in politics.  It
  so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
  is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
  Peers!</p>

<p style = "margin-left:40px;">
     When Britain really ruled the waves—<br>
                 (In good Queen Bess's time)<br>
            The House of Peers made no pretence<br>
            To intellectual eminence,<br>
                 Or scholarship sublime;<br>
            Yet Britain won her proudest bays<br>
            In good Queen Bess's glorious days!<br></p>

  <h3>CHORUS.</h3>        
  <p style = "margin-left:40px;">Yes, Britain won, etc.<br></p>

<p style = "margin-left:40px;">
     When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,<br>
                 As every child can tell,<br>
            The House of Peers, throughout the war,<br>
            Did nothing in particular,<br>
                 And did it very well:<br>
            Yet Britain set the world ablaze<br>
            In good King George's glorious days!<br></p>

  <h3>CHORUS.</h3>        
  <p style = "margin-left:40px;">Yes, Britain set, etc.<br></p>

<p stlye = "margin-left:40px;">
     And while the House of Peers withholds<br>
                 Its legislative hand,<br>
            And noble statesmen do not itch<br>
            To interfere with matters which<br>
                 They do not understand,<br>
            As bright will shine Great Britain's rays<br>
            As in King George's glorious days!<br></p>

  <h3>CHORUS.</h3>
