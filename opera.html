        ACT II
  Scene.—Palace Yard, Westminster.  Westminster Hall, L.  Clock
  tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight.

                        SONG—PRIVATE WILLIS.

  When all night long a chap remains
       On sentry-go, to chase monotony
  He exercises of his brains,
       That is, assuming that he's got any.
  Though never nurtured in the lap
       Of luxury, yet I admonish you,
  I am an intellectual chap,
       And think of things that would astonish you.
            I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!
            How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!
                 That every boy and every gal
                      That's born into the world alive
                 Is either a little Liberal
                      Or else a little Conservative!
                                     Fal, lal, la!

  When in that House M.P.'s divide,
       If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,
  They've got to leave that brain outside,
       And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.
  But then the prospect of a lot
       Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,
  All thinking for themselves, is what
       No man can face with equanimity.
            Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!
            That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!
                 That every boy and every gal
                      That's born into the world alive
                 Is either a little Liberal
                      Or else a little Conservative!
                                     Fal lal la!

  (Enter Fairies, with Celia, Leila, and Fleta.  They trip round
  stage.)

                         CHORUS OF FAIRIES.

            Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
            Carries every Bill he chooses.
            To his measures all assent—
                 Showing that fairies have their uses.
                      Whigs and Tories
                      Dim their glories,
            Giving an ear to all his stories—
            Lords and Commons are both in the blues!
            Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!
                 Shake in their shoes!
                 Shake in their shoes!
            Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!

  (Enter Peers from Westminster Hall.)

                          CHORUS OF PEERS.

            Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
                 Running a-muck of all abuses.
            His unqualified assent
                 Somehow nobody now refuses.
                      Whigs and Tories
                      Dim their glories,
            Giving an ear to all his stories
            Carrying every Bill he may wish:
            Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
                 Kettle of fish!
                 Kettle of fish!
            Here's a pretty kettle of fish!

  (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller from Westminster Hall.)

       CELIA.  You seem annoyed.
       LORD MOUNT.  Annoyed!  I should think so!  Why, this
  ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
  To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
  open to Competitive Examination!
       LORD TOLL.  And he'll carry it, too!
       LORD MOUNT.  Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
  Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!
       LEILA.  Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!
       LORD MOUNT.  The deuce it is!
       CELIA.  Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
  just as he wishes them to.
       LEILA.  It's our system.  It shortens the debates.
       LORD TOLL.  Well, but think what it all means.  I don't so
  much mind for myself, but with a House of Peers with no
  grandfathers worth mentioning, the country must go to the dogs!
       LEILA.  I suppose it must!
       LORD MOUNT.  I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
  a great respect for brains—I often wish I had some myself—but
  with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,
  what's to become of the House of Commons?
       LEILA.  I never thought of that!
       LORD MOUNT.  This comes of women interfering in politics.  It
  so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
  is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
  Peers!

                       SONG—LORD MOUNTARARAT.

            When Britain really ruled the waves—
                 (In good Queen Bess's time)
            The House of Peers made no pretence
            To intellectual eminence,
                 Or scholarship sublime;
            Yet Britain won her proudest bays
            In good Queen Bess's glorious days!

  CHORUS.        Yes, Britain won, etc.

            When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,
                 As every child can tell,
            The House of Peers, throughout the war,
            Did nothing in particular,
                 And did it very well:
            Yet Britain set the world ablaze
            In good King George's glorious days!

  CHORUS.        Yes, Britain set, etc.

            And while the House of Peers withholds
                 Its legislative hand,
            And noble statesmen do not itch
            To interfere with matters which
                 They do not understand,
            As bright will shine Great Britain's rays
            As in King George's glorious days!

  CHORUS.        As bright will shine, etc.

       LEILA. (who has been much attracted by the Peers during this
  song).  Charming persons, are they not?
       CELIA.  Distinctly.  For self-contained dignity, combined with
  airy condescension, give me a British Representative Peer!
       LORD TOLL.  Then pray stop this protege of yours before it's
  too late.  Think of the mischief you're doing!
       LEILA (crying).  But we can't stop him now.  (Aside to Celia.)
  Aren't they lovely!  (Aloud.)  Oh, why did you go and defy us, you
  great geese!

                       DUET—LEILA and CELIA.

  LEILA.              In vain to us you plead—
                                     Don't go!
                      Your prayers we do not heed—
                                     Don't go!
                           It's true we sigh,
                                But don't suppose
                           A tearful eye
                                Forgiveness shows.
                                     Oh, no!
                      We're very cross indeed—
                           Yes, very cross,
                                     Don't go!

  FAIRIES.                 It's true we sigh, etc.

  CELIA.              Your disrespectful sneers—
                                     Don't go!
                      Call forth indignant tears—
                                     Don't go!
                           You break our laws—
                                You are our foe:
                           We cry because
                                We hate you so!
                                     You know!
                      You very wicked Peers!
                           You wicked Peers!
                                     Don't go!

       FAIRIES.                      LORDS MOUNT. and TOLL.

  You break our laws—          Our disrespectful sneers,
       You are our foe:                   Ha, ha!
  We cry because                Call forth indignant tears,
       We hate you so!                    Ha, ha!
                 You know!      If that's the case, my dears—
  You very wicked Peers!   FAIRIES.  Don't go!
                 Don't go! PEERS.    We'll go!

  (Exeunt Lord Mountararat, Lord Tolloller, and Peers.  Fairies gaze
  wistfully after them.)

                          (Enter Fairy Queen.)

       QUEEN.  Oh, shame—shame upon you!  Is this your fidelity to
  the laws you are bound to obey?  Know ye not that it is death to
  marry a mortal?
       LEILA.  Yes, but it's not death to wish to marry a mortal!
       FLETA.  If it were, you'd have to execute us all!
       QUEEN.  Oh, this is weakness!  Subdue it!
       CELIA.  We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!
       LEILA.  We are not all as tough as you are!
       QUEEN.  Tough!  Do you suppose that I am insensible to the
  effect of manly beauty?  Look at that man!  (Referring to Sentry.)
  A perfect picture!  (To Sentry.)  Who are you, sir?
       WILLIS (coming to "attention").  Private Willis, B Company,
  1st Grenadier Guards.
       QUEEN.  You're a very fine fellow, sir.
       WILLIS.  I am generally admired.
       QUEEN.  I can quite understand it.  (To Fairies.)  Now here is
  a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike.  That man has
  a most extraordinary effect upon me.  If I yielded to a natural
  impulse, I should fall down and worship that man.  But I mortify
  this inclination; I wrestle with it, and it lies beneath my feet!
  That is how I treat my regard for that man!

                         SONG—FAIRY QUEEN.

                      Oh, foolish fay,
                           Think you, because
                      His brave array
                           My bosom thaws,
                      I'd disobey
                           Our fairy laws?
                      Because I fly
                           In realms above,
                      In tendency
                           To fall in love,
                      Resemble I
                           The amorous dove?
  (Aside.)            Oh, amorous dove!
                           Type of Ovidius Naso!
                                This heart of mine
                                Is soft as thine,
                      Although I dare not say so!

  CHORUS.             Oh, amorous dove, etc.

                      On fire that glows
                           With heat intense
                      I turn the hose
                           Of common sense,
                      And out it goes
                           At small expense!
                      We must maintain
                           Our fairy law;
                      That is the main
                           On which to draw—
                      In that we gain
                           A Captain Shaw!
  (Aside.)                 Oh, Captain Shaw!
                                Type of true love kept under!
                                     Could thy Brigade
                                     With cold cascade
                                Quench my great love, I wonder!

  CHORUS.             Oh, Captain Shaw! etc.

               (Exeunt Fairies and Fairy Queen, sorrowfully.)

                             (Enter Phyllis.)

       PHYL.  (half crying).  I can't think why I'm not in better
  spirits.  I'm engaged to two noblemen at once.  That ought to be
  enough to make any girl happy.  But I'm miserable!  Don't suppose
  it's because I care for Strephon, for I hate him!  No girl could
  care for a man who goes about with a mother considerably younger
  than himself!

              (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller.)

       LORD MOUNT.  Phyllis!  My darling!
       LORD TOLL.  Phyllis!  My own!
       PHYL.  Don't!  How dare you?  Oh, but perhaps you're the two
  noblemen I'm engaged to?
       LORD MOUNT.  I am one of them.
       LORD TOLL.  I am the other.
       PHYL.  Oh, then, my darling!  (to Lord Mountararat).  My own!
  (to Lord Tolloller).  Well, have you settled which it's to be?
       LORD TOLL.  Not altogether.  It's a difficult position.  It
  would be hardly delicate to toss up.  On the whole we would rather
  leave it to you.
       PHYL.  How can it possibly concern me?  You are both EarIs,
  and you are both rich, and you are both plain.
       LORD MOUNT.  So we are.  At least I am.
       LORD TOLL.  So am I.
       LORD MOUNT.  No, no!
       LORD TOLL.  I am indeed.  Very plain.
       LORD MOUNT.  Well, well—perhaps you are.
       PHYL.  There's really nothing to choose between you.  If one
  of you would forgo his title, and distribute his estates among his
  Irish tenantry, why, then, I should then see a reason for accepting
  the other.
       LORD MOUNT.  Tolloller, are you prepared to make this
  sacrifice?
       LORD TOLL.  No!
       LORD MOUNT.  Not even to oblige a lady?
       LORD TOLL.  No! not even to oblige a lady.
       LORD MOUNT.  Then, the only question is, which of us shall
  give way to the other?  Perhaps, on the whole, she would be happier
  with me.  I don't know.  I may be wrong.
       LORD TOLL.  No.  I don't know that you are.  I really believe
  she would.  But the awkward part of the thing is that if you rob me
  of the girl of my heart, we must fight, and one of us must die.
  It's a family tradition that I have sworn to respect.  It's a
  painful position, for I have a very strong regard for you, George.
       LORD MOUNT. (much affected).  My dear Thomas!
       LORD TOLL.  You are very dear to me, George.  We were boys
  together—at least I was.  If I were to survive you, my existence
  would be hopelessly embittered.
       LORD MOUNT.  Then, my dear Thomas, you must not do it.  I say
  it again and again—if it will have this effect upon you, you must
  not do it.  No, no.  If one of us is to destroy the other, let it
  be me!
       LORD TOLL.  No, no!
       LORD MOUNT.  Ah, yes!—by our boyish friendship I implore you!
       LORD TOLL. (much moved).  Well, well, be it so.  But,
  no—no!—I cannot consent to an act which would crush you with
  unavaillng remorse.
       LORD MOUNT.  But it would not do so.  I should be very sad at
  first—oh, who would not be?—but it would wear off.  I like you
  very much—but not, perhaps, as much as you like me.
       LORD TOLL.  George, you're a noble fellow, but that tell-tale
  tear betrays you.  No, George; you are very fond of me, and I
  cannot consent to give you a week's uneasiness on my account.
       LORD MOUNT.  But, dear Thomas, it would not last a week!
  Remember, you lead the House of Lords!  On your demise I shall take
  your place!  Oh, Thomas, it would not last a day!
       PHYL. (coming down).  Now, I do hope you're not going to fight
  about me, because it's really not worth while.
       LORD TOLL. (looking at her).  Well, I don't believe it is!
       LORD MOUNT.  Nor I.  The sacred ties of Friendship are
  paramount.

                     QUARTET—LORD MOUNTARARAT,
            LORD TOLLOLLER, PHYLLIS, and PRIVATE WILLIS.

  LORD TOLL.     Though p'r'aps I may incur your blame,
                      The things are few
                      I would not do
                 In Friendship's name!

  LORD MOUNT.    And I may say I think the same;
                      Not even love
                      Should rank above
                 True Friendship's name!

  PHYL.          Then free me, pray; be mine the blame;
                      Forget your craze
                      And go your ways
                 In Friendship's name!

  ALL.           Oh, many a man, in Friendship's name,
                 Has yielded fortune, rank, and fame!
                 But no one yet, in the world so wide,
                 Has yielded up a promised bride!

  WILLIS.        Accept, O Friendship, all the same,

  ALL.           This sacrifice to thy dear name!

  (Exeunt Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller, lovingly, in one
  direction, and Phyllis in another.  Exit Sentry.)

                 (Enter Lord Chancellor, very miserable.)

                    RECITATIVE—LORD CHANCELLOR.

            Love, unrequited, robs me of my rest:
                 Love, hopeless love, my ardent soul encumbers:
            Love, nightmare-like, lies heavy on my chest,
                 And weaves itself into my midnight slumbers!

                       SONG—LORD CHANCELLOR.

  When you're lying awake with a dismal headache, and repose is
  taboo'd by anxiety,
  I conceive you may use any language you choose to indulge in,
  without impropriety;
  For your brain is on fire—the bedclothes conspire of usual
  slumber to plunder you:
  First your counterpane goes, and uncovers your toes, and your
  sheet slips demurely from under you;
  Then the blanketing tickles—you feel like mixed pickles—so
  terribly sharp is the pricking,
  And you're hot, and you're cross, and you tumble and toss till
  there's nothing 'twixt you and the ticking.
  Then the bedclothes all creep to the ground in a heap, and you
  pick 'em all up in a tangle;
  Next your pillow resigns and politely declines to remain at its
  usual angle!
  Well, you get some repose in the form of a doze, with hot
  eye-balls and head ever aching.
  But your slumbering teems with such horrible dreams that you'd
  very much better be waking;
  For you dream you are crossing the Channel, and tossing about in
  a steamer from Harwich—
  Which is something between a large bathing machine and a very
  small second-class carriage—
  And you're giving a treat (penny ice and cold meat) to a party of
  friends and relations—
  They're a ravenous horde—and they all came on board at Sloane
  Square and South Kensington Stations.
  And bound on that journey you find your attorney (who started  that
  morning from Devon);
  He's a bit undersized, and you don't feel surprised when he tells
  you he's only eleven.
  Well, you're driving like mad with this singular lad (by the by,
  the ship's now a four-wheeler),
  And you're playing round games, and he calls you bad names when
  you tell him that "ties pay the dealer";
  But this you can't stand, so you throw up your hand, and you find
  you're as cold as an icicle,
  In your shirt and your socks (the black silk with gold clocks),
  crossing Salisbury Plain on a bicycle:
  And he and the crew are on bicycles too—which they've somehow   or
  other invested in—
  And he's telling the tars all the particulars of a company he's
  interested in—
  It's a scheme of devices, to get at low prices all goods from
  cough mixtures to cables
  (Which tickled the sailors), by treating retailers as though they
  were all vegetables—
  You get a good spadesman to plant a small tradesman (first take
  off his boots with a boot-tree),
  And his legs will take root, and his fingers will shoot, and
  they'll blossom and bud like a fruit-tree—
  From the greengrocer tree you get grapes and green pea,
  cauliflower, pineapple, and cranberries,
  While the pastrycook plant cherry brandy will grant, apple puffs,
  and three corners, and Banburys—
  The shares are a penny, and ever so many are taken by Rothschild
  and Baring,
  And just as a few are allotted to you, you awake with a shudder
  despairing—
  You're a regular wreck, with a crick in your neck, and no wonder
  you snore, for your head's on the floor, and you've needles and
  pins from your soles to your shins, and your flesh is a-creep, for
  your left leg's asleep, and you've cramp in your toes, and a fly on
  your nose, and some fluff in your lung, and a feverish tongue, and
  a thirst that's intense, and a general sense that you haven't been
  sleeping in clover;
  But the darkness has passed, and it's daylight at last, and the
  night has been long—ditto ditto my song—and thank goodness
  they're both of them over!

                                 (Lord Chancellor falls exhausted on
  a seat.)

              (Enter Lords Mountararat and Tolloller.)

       LORD MOUNT.  I am much distressed to see your Lordship in this
  condition.
       LORD CH.  Ah, my Lords, it is seldom that a Lord Chancellor
  has reason to envy the position of another, but I am free to
  confess that I would rather be two Earls engaged to Phyllis than
  any other half-dozen noblemen upon the face of the globe.
       LORD TOLL. (without enthusiasm).  Yes.  It's an enviable
  position when you're the only one.
       LORD MOUNT.  Oh yes, no doubt—most enviable.  At the same
  time, seeing you thus, we naturally say to ourselves, "This is very
  sad.  His Lordship is constitutionally as blithe as a bird—he
  trills upon the bench like a thing of song and gladness.  His
  series of judgements in F sharp minor, given andante in six-eight
  time, are among the most remarkable effects ever produced in a
  Court of Chancery.  He is, perhaps, the only living instance of a
  judge whose decrees have received the honour of a double encore.
  How can we bring ourselves to do that which will deprive the Court
  of Chancery of one of its most attractive features?"
       LORD CH.  I feel the force of your remarks, but I am here in
  two capacities, and they clash, my Lords, they clash!  I deeply
  grieve to say that in declining to entertain my last application to
  myself, I presumed to address myself in terms which render it
  impossible for me ever to apply to myself again.  It was a most
  painful scene, my Lords—most painful!
       LORD TOLL.  This is what it is to have two capacities!  Let us
  be thankful that we are persons of no capacity whatever.
       LORD MOUNT.  Come, come.  Remember you are a very just and
  kindly old gentleman, and you need have no hesitation in
  approaching yourself, so that you do so respectfully and with a
  proper show of deference.
       LORD CH.  Do you really think so?
       LORD MOUNT.  I do.
       LORD CH.  Well, I will nerve myself to another effort, and,
  if that fails, I resign myself to my fate!

       TRIO—LORD CHANCELLOR, LORDS MOUNTARARAT and TOLLOLLER.

  LORD MOUNT.         If you go in
                      You're sure to win—
                 Yours will be the charming maidie:
                      Be your law
                      The ancient saw,
                 "Faint heart never won fair lady!"

  ALL.           Never, never, never,
                 Faint heart never won fair lady!
                      Every journey has an end—
                      When at the worst affairs will mend—
                      Dark the dawn when day is nigh—
                      Hustle your horse and don't say die!

  LORD TOLL.          He who shies
                      At such a prize
                 Is not worth a maravedi,
                      Be so kind
                      To bear in mind—
                 Faint heart never won fair lady!

  ALL.           Never, never, never,
                 Faint heart never won fair lady!
                      While the sun shines make your hay—
                      Where a will is, there's a way—
                      Beard the lion in his lair—
                      None but the brave deserve the fair!

  LORD CH.            I'll take heart
                      And make a start—
                 Though I fear the prospect's shady—
                      Much I'd spend
                      To gain my end—
                 Faint heart never won fair lady!

  ALL.           Never, never, never,
                 Faint heart never won fair lady!
                      Nothing venture, nothing win—
                      Blood is thick, but water's thin—
                      In for a penny, in for a pound—
                      It's Love that makes the world go round!

                                     (Dance, and exeunt arm-in-arm
  together.)

                   (Enter Strephon, in very low spirits.)

  [The following song was deleted from production]

            Fold your flapping wings,
                 Soaring legislature.
            Stoop to little things,
                 Stoop to human nature.
            Never need to roam
                 members patriotic.
            Let's begin at home,
                 Crime is no exotic.
            Bitter is your bane
                 Terrible your trials
            Dingy Drury Lane
                 Soapless Seven Dials.
            Take a tipsy lout
                 Gathered from the gutter,
            Hustle him about,
                 Strap him to a shutter.
            What am I but he,
                 Washed at hours stated.
            Fed on filagree,
                 Clothed and educated
            He's a mark of scorn
                 I might be another
            If I had been born
                 Of a tipsy mother.
            Take a wretched thief,
                 Through the city sneaking.
            Pocket handkerchief
                 Ever, ever seeking.
            What is he but I
                 Robbed of all my chances
            Picking pockets by
                 force of circumstances
                      I might be as bad,
                           As unlucky, rather,
                      If I'd only had,
                           Fagin for a father.

       STREPH.  I suppose one ought to enjoy oneself in Parliament,
  when one leads both Parties, as I do!  But I'm miserable, poor,
  broken-hearted fool that I am!  Oh Phyllis, Phyllis!—

                            (Enter Phyllis.)
       PHYL.  Yes.
       STREPH. (surprised).  Phyllis!  But I suppose I should say "My
  Lady."  I have not yet been informed which title your ladyship has
  pleased to select?
       PHYL.  I—I haven't quite decided.  You see, I have no mother
  to advise me!
       STREPH.  No.  I have.
       PHYL.  Yes; a young mother.
       STREPH.  Not very—a couple of centuries or so.
       PHYL.  Oh!  She wears well.
       STREPH.  She does.  She's a fairy.
       PHYL.  I beg your pardon—a what?
       STREPH.  Oh, I've no longer any reason to conceal the
  fact—she's a fairy.
       PHYL.  A fairy!  Well, but—that would account for a good many
  things!  Then—I suppose you're a fairy?
       STREPH.  I'm half a fairy.
       PHYL.  Which half?
       STREPH.  The upper half—down to the waistcoat.
       PHYL.  Dear me!  (Prodding him with her fingers.)  There is
  nothing to show it!
       STREPH.  Don't do that.
       PHYL.  But why didn't you tell me this before?
       STREPH.  I thought you would take a dislike to me.  But as
  it's all off, you may as well know the truth—I'm only half a
  mortal!
       PHYL. (crying).  But I'd rather have half a mortal I do love,
  than half a dozen I don't!
       STREPH.  Oh, I think not—go to your half-dozen.
       PHYL. (crying).  It's only two! and I hate 'em!  Please
  forgive me!
       STREPH.  I don't think I ought to.  Besides, all sorts of
  difficulties will arise.  You know, my grandmother looks quite as
  young as my mother.  So do all my aunts.
       PHYL.  I quite understand.  Whenever I see you kissing a very
  young lady, I shall know it's an elderly relative.
       STREPH.  You will?  Then, Phyllis, I think we shall be very
  happy!  (Embracing her.)
       PHYL.  We won't wait long.
       STREPH.  No.  We might change our minds.  We'll get married
  first.
       PHYL.  And change our minds afterwards?
       STREPH.  That's the usual course.

                     DUET—STREPHON and PHYLLIS.

  STREPH.        If we're weak enough to tarry
                      Ere we marry,
                           You and I,
                 Of the feeling I inspire
                      You may tire
                           By and by.
                 For peers with flowing coffers
                      Press their offers—
                           That is why
                 I am sure we should not tarry
                      Ere we marry,
                           You and I!

  PHYL.          If we're weak enough to tarry
                      Ere we marry,
                           You and I,
                 With a more attractive maiden,
                      Jewel-laden,
                           You may fly.
                 If by chance we should be parted,
                      Broken-hearted
                           I should die—
                 So I think we will not tarry
                      Ere we marry,
                           You and I.

       PHYL.  But does your mother know you're—I mean, is she aware
  of our engagement?

                         (Enter Iolanthe.)

       IOL.  She is; and thus she welcomes her daughter-in-law!
  (Kisses her.)
       PHYL.  She kisses just like other people!  But the Lord
  Chancellor?
       STREPH.  I forgot him!  Mother, none can resist your fairy
  eloquence; you will go to him and plead for us?
       IOL. (much agitated).  No, no; impossible!
       STREPH.  But our happiness—our very lives—depend upon our
  obtaining his consent!
       PHYL.  Oh, madam, you cannot refuse to do this!
       IOL.  You know not what you ask!  The Lord Chancellor is—my
  husband!
  STREPH. and PHYL.  Your husband!
       IOL.  My husband and your father!  (Addressing Strephon, who
  is much moved.)
       PHYLL.  Then our course is plain; on his learning that
  Strephon is his son, all objection to our marriage will be at once
  removed!
       IOL.  No; he must never know!  He believes me to have died
  childless, and, dearly as I love him, I am bound, under penalty of
  death, not to undeceive him.  But see—he comes!  Quick—my veil!

  (Iolanthe veils herself.  Strephon and Phyllis go off on tiptoe.)

                      (Enter Lord Chancellor.)

       LORD CH.  Victory!  Victory!  Success has crowned my efforts,
  and I may consider myself engaged to Phyllis!  At first I wouldn't
  hear of it—it was out of the question.  But I took heart.  I
  pointed out to myself that I was no stranger to myself; that, in
  point of fact, I had been personally acquainted with myself for
  some years.  This had its effect.  I admitted that I had watched my
  professional advancement with considerable interest, and I
  handsomely added that I yielded to no one in admiration for my
  private and professional virtues.  This was a great point gained.
  I then endeavoured to work upon my feelings.  Conceive my joy when
  I distinctly perceived a tear glistening in my own eye!
  Eventually, after a severe struggle with myself, I
  reluctantly—most reluctantly—consented.

                                                (Iolanthe comes down
  veiled.)

                    RECITATIVE—IOLANTHE (kneeling).

            My lord, a suppliant at your feet I kneel,
            Oh, listen to a mother's fond appeal!
            Hear me to-night!  I come in urgent need—
            'Tis for my son, young Strephon, that I plead!

                          BALLAD—IOLANTHE.

                 He loves!  If in the bygone years
                      Thine eyes have ever shed
                 Tears—bitter, unavailing tears,
                      For one untimely dead—
                 If, in the eventide of life,
                      Sad thoughts of her arise,
                 Then let the memory of thy wife
                      Plead for my boy—he dies!

                 He dies!  If fondly laid aside
                      In some old cabinet,
                 Memorials of thy long-dead bride
                      Lie, dearly treasured yet,
                 Then let her hallowed bridal dress—
                      Her little dainty gloves—
                 Her withered flowers—her faded tress—
                      Plead for my boy—he loves!

  (The Lord Chancellor is moved by this appeal.  After a pause.)

  LORD CH.  It may not be—for so the fates decide!
            Learn thou that Phyllis is my promised bride.
  IOL. (in horror).   Thy bride!  No! no!
  LORD CH.            It shall be so!
            Those who would separate us woe betide!

  IOL.      My doom thy lips have spoken—
                                I plead in vain!

  CHORUS OF FAIRIES (without).       Forbear! forbear!

  IOL.      A vow already broken
                                I break again!

  CHORUS OF FAIRIES (without).       Forbear! forbear!

  IOL.      For him—for her—for thee
                                I yield my life.
            Behold—it may not be!
                                I am thy wife.

  CHORUS OF FAIRIES (without).       Aiaiah! Aiaiah! Willaloo!

  LORD CH. (recognizing her).   Iolanthe! thou livest?

  IOL.                                    Aye!
                                I live!  Now let me die!

  (Enter Fairy Queen and Fairies.  Iolanthe kneels to her.)

  QUEEN.    Once again thy vows are broken:
            Thou thyself thy doom hast spoken!

  CHORUS OF FAIRIES.            Aiaiah! Aiaiah!
                                     Willahalah! Willaloo!
                                     Willahalah! Willaloo!

  QUEEN.    Bow thy head to Destiny:
            Death thy doom, and thou shalt die!

  CHORUS OF FAIRIES.            Aiaiah! Aiaiah! etc.

  (Peers and Sentry enter.  The Queen raises her spear.)

       LEILA.  Hold!  If Iolanthe must die, so must we all; for, as
  she has sinned, so have we!
       QUEEN.  What?
       CELIA.  We are all fairy duchesses, marchionesses, countesses,
  viscountesses, and baronesses.
       LORD MOUNT.  It's our fault.  They couldn't help themselves.
       QUEEN.  It seems they have helped themselves, and pretty
  freely, too!  (After a pause.)  You have all incurred death; but I
  can't slaughter the whole company!  And yet (unfolding a scroll)
  the law is clear—every fairy must die who marries a mortal!
       LORD CH.  Allow me, as an old Equity draftsman, to make a
  suggestion.  The subtleties of the legal mind are equal to the
  emergency.  The thing is really quite simple—the insertion of a
  single word will do it.  Let it stand that every fairy shall die
  who doesn't marry a mortal, and there you are, out of your
  difficulty at once!
       QUEEN.  We like your humour.  Very well!  (Altering the MS. in
  pencil.)  Private Willis!
       SENTRY (coming forward).  Ma'am!
       QUEEN.  To save my life, it is necessary that I marry at once.
  How should you like to be a fairy guardsman?
       SENTRY.  Well, ma'am, I don't think much of the British
  soldier who wouldn't ill-convenience himself to save a female in
  distress.
       QUEEN.  You are a brave fellow.  You're a fairy from this
  moment.  (Wings spring from Sentry's shoulders.)  And you, my
  Lords, how say you, will you join our ranks?

                          (Fairies kneel to Peers and implore them to
  do so.)

                      (Phyllis and Strephon enter.)

       LORD MOUNT. (to Lord Tolloller).  Well, now that the Peers are
  to be recruited entirely from persons of intelligence, I really
  don't see what use we are, down here, do you, Tolloller?
       LORD TOLL.  None whatever.
       QUEEN.  Good!  (Wings spring from shoulders of Peers.)  Then
  away we go to Fairyland.

                               FINALE.

  PHYL.               Soon as we may,
                      Off and away!
                 We'll commence our journey airy—
                      Happy are we—
                      As you can see,
                 Every one is now a fairy!

  ALL.           Every, every, every,
                 Every one is now a fairy!

  IOL., QUEEN,   Though as a general rule we know
  and PHYL.      Two strings go to every bow,
                 Make up your minds that grief 'twill bring
                 If you've two beaux to every string.

  ALL.           Though as a general rule, etc.

  LORDCH.             Up in the sky,
                      Ever so high,
                 Pleasures come in endless series;
                      We will arrange
                      Happy exchange—
                 House of Peers for House of Peris!

  ALL.           Peris, Peris, Peris,
                 House of Peers for House of Peris!

  LORDS CH.,          Up in the air, sky-high, sky-high,
  MOUNT.,             Free from Wards in Chancery,
  and TOLL.           I/He will be surely happier, for
