     When all night long a chap remains<br>
       On sentry-go, to chase monotony<br>
  He exercises of his brains,<br>
       That is, assuming that he's got any.<br>
  Though never nurtured in the lap<br>
       Of luxury, yet I admonish you,<br>
  I am an intellectual chap,<br>
       And think of things that would astonish you.<br>
            I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!<br>
            How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!<br>
                 That every boy and every gal<br>
                      That's born into the world alive<br>
                 Is either a little Liberal<br>
                      Or else a little Conservative!<br>
                                     Fal, lal, la!<br>

  When in that House M.P.'s divide,<br>
       If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,<br>
  They've got to leave that brain outside,<br>
       And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.<br>
  But then the prospect of a lot<br>
       Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,<br>
  All thinking for themselves, is what<br>
       No man can face with equanimity.<br>
            Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!<br>
            That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!<br>
                 That every boy and every gal<br>
                      That's born into the world alive<br>
                 Is either a little Liberal<br>
                      Or else a little Conservative!<br>
                                     Fal lal la!<br></p>
